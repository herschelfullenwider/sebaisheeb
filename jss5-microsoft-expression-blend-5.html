EDIT 2: Okay, after playing for a while and reconfiguring the graphics settings, I found something curious: I set up the graphics configuration to "Full Screen" and 1920 1080 resolution (my screen). Other graphic options were set to the default "Standard (Laptop)". With this set, after I logged out, the game crashed causing 3 or 4 windows like the one in the problem to appear (with different .exe files crashing).

Hi everyone! I'm Pixelated Pope, and I've been using Microsoft's Expression Blend for both Silverlight and WPF development for over 5 years. The purpose of this subreddit is to provide a place for our relatively small community of designers and developers who use Blend to ask and answer questions. Hopefully you can get the help you need and you'll stick around to share your expertise with other users.

Let's say you have read my first post ( and made a cool diagram to organize your project. You now have two options : 1 : You are quite good at designing things, you won't have any major problem to make a coherent, well organised UI. Uh I feel so nooby compared to you 2 : Like me, you are (awfully) bad at designing things, and know that if you don't do something before rushing into RStudio.

When I first got it ~3 years ago, the very first thing I remember doing is disabling Windows Update. As far as I know, my machine has never updated anything Microsoft related, ever. Fast forward to today. A programming class of mine requires Microsoft Expression Blend. Microsoft Expression Blend requires NET framework 4.0 to install. The NET framework 4.0 installer expects to use Windows Update (which I thought was simply disabled).

I finally got around to trying my hand a Fabulous yesterday to rework my F# Chess (https://github.com/JordanMarr/FsharpChess) learning project. It was easier than I anticipated! It was very nice to be able to consume the F# back-end directly without having to use an interop class and DTOs to conceal the discriminated unions and other F# bits. The only small criticism I have is that I missed being able to click on a xaml element to see the Properties grid to browse the available properties. 
I've created a PowerShell script which runs in the background while a Task Sequence is running, providing the overall progress of the sequence on screen. Yes there are a number of these around but this works well and is only 50 lines of code and no package. It was inspired by Damien Van Robaeys's attempts. I have been trying to create a script that can run without a package so it can be the first step in a bare metal deployment. To use it, use the new PowerShell script function. Java-slamming is a well known past-time and I'm no special case, yet Java is the top programming language right now by numerous measures. Despite whether one believes that Java is currently developing, stagnating, or biting the dust, one needs to concede that Java had genuinely upset and had characterized the programming of XXI Century as we probably am aware it. Java had joined and conveyed to the majority huge amounts of helpful programming language includes that were already accessible Built a basic new-user GUI for the helpdesk; and trying to learn the GUI part of things.

Hello guys, I've been wasting my time today lol. I tried 700 things in 700 ways but i dont seem to get any further So im trying my luck here! Any help would be greatly appreciated!! This is not my original code, but it is the original XAML. I've been using a tutorial for the XAML reader: https://foxdeploy.com/2015/04/10/part-i-creating-powershell-guis-in-minutes-using-visual-studio-a-new-hope/ (https://foxdeploy.com/2015/04/10/part-i-creating-powershell-guis-in-minutes-using-visual-studio. Hi community, I'm a little desparate because I've been searching all day for even just hints. So maybe you know what I could do. What I want to achieve is: I want to have some kind of template for a TextBox which has a little extra functionality that has to be done in code. This template needs to be used quiet a lot in different windows and also as DataTemplate in an ItemsControl Element. So a UserControl seems to be the best choice. How could this be done? I'm using MVVM Light in this Applicat. I have this XAML for a window. i need to store border position in a database and be able to do drag and drop i tried to add to the margin but i couldn't get it to react to the drag and drop i think i'm missing some event üì∑:/ 1. using System.Windows; using System.Windows.Controls; using System.Windows.Input; using System.Windows.Media; namespace CatalogApp { /// /// Interaction logic for PicLabelControl.xaml. Below is my code. I want to know a good way to go about pressing a button on my window and by pressing that button I want to change the content from $xaml to $page2. Not sure if I'm going about it the right way by posting multiple XAML markups per page. Currently I was closing the original window and opening a new one on button press, but that is not ideal. I would much rather prefer changing the content on the existing window. I have tried to change the content of the window 
Hello everybody, Binding is a lot of fun. I still don't understand it, and I need your help. I have a custom control, just a textbox to display a value of type double.

Hi, I don't seem to find a way to bring my C# classes to the XAML side.

Hi all, I've been trying to make some GUI scripts and accessing/using the entered data is proving a probelm. I'm following some online examples but none are doing what I need. I've created a really minimalist script as a starter.

Hi, I am just started with WPF developement so I have this question. How can I "switch" pages on clicking ListItemViews? So I just want to show AddUser, ShowUser etc Pages in gray area when I click on corresponding ListItemViews. I have 2 days of experience with C# and WPF so sorry if this is silly question. Here is my code and screenshoot screenshot (https://i.imgur.com/lkB56Ba.png). 1. What is the Matrix In my opinion, The Matrix films provide the best metaphor our society has for understanding why organized evil and oppression are allowed to exist, and so I will use it for this purpose. While my interpretation isn't the only possible one, I believe it to be valid, comprehensive, and most importantly, illustrative of the message I am trying to convey. So let's begin by discussing what the Matrix is not. The Matrix is not the physical world. As far as I'm concerned I have this PowerShell function that takes some XAML data and uses it to start a WPF UI. I have several bits of XAML I have used successfully, but my most recent one, is causing problems. After assigning the XAML to the $inputXML variable, I run: $inputXML = $inputXML.Window -replace "x:N",'N' -replace.
